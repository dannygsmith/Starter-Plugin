# Sandbox Workspace

This repository is a WordPress plugin that gives you a sandbox workspace to write code, test, and learn.  It's where you _play_.  I use it on [KnowTheCode.io](https://knowthecode.io) in the hands-on labs.

You can use however you'd like.

## Installation

1. Download it.
2. Put into your `wp-content/plugins/` folder
3. Extract it
4. Go into the new folder
5. Then go to plugins and activate it.


Installation from GitHub is as simple as cloning the repo onto your local machine.  To clone the repo, do the following:

1. Using PhpStorm, open your project and navigate to `wp-content/plugins/`. (Or open terminal and navigate there).
2. Then type: `git clone https://github.com/KnowTheCode/Sandbox-Workspace`.
3. Go into the new folder
4. Then go to plugins and activate it.
